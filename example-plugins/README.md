Put folders and files here to have them installed into `$HOME` automatically during each launch of the app after installation.

Files and folders that have "bootstrap" in their names will be placed inside the `.apk`, but they will be ignored during each app launch unless they are specifically named `bootstrap-aarch64.zip` or `bootstrap-x86_64.zip`, in which case one of them will be used as the termux bootstrap if appropriate.
